title: "BioFindr Tutorials"
---

Welcome to a set of tutorials for the [BioFindr.jl][1] package, an implementation of the [Findr software](https://github.com/lingfeiwang/findr) in [Julia](https://julialang.org/). BioFindr is a software package for [coexpression analysis](coexpression.qmd), [association analysis](association.qmd), and [causal inference](causal-inference.qmd) from multi-omics data.

The methods implemented in BioFindr were developed by [Lingfei Wang](https://github.com/lingfeiwang) and [Tom Michoel](https://tmichoel.github.io), and were first described in the paper ["Efficient and accurate causal inference with hidden confounders from genome-transcriptome variation data"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005703).

These tutorials should be read alongside the [BioFindr.jl documentation][2]. Make sure to read the [installation instructions](installation.qmd) if you want to run these tutorials locally.
